# Procedural Terrain Generation

Procedural terrain with camera controls, implemented from scratch using only OpenGL. The terrain generation uses a combination of the diamond-square algorithm and Perlin noise.

This was for a final project for the course CS 354 - Computer Graphics at UT Austin. Completed in spring 2016.
